<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Rofi Applets Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://gitlab.com/Zhaith-Izaliel/rofi-applets)

Rofi Applets is a collection of dmenu bash utilities built for Rofi, similar to
[Aditya Shakya's Rofi applets][adi1090x-rofi] but built specifically to work
with Nix and Home Manager while not assuming theming by default.

These applets have high customizations capabilities you can easily set up using
their corresponding Home Manager modules, or just by creating their theme and
updating their `.conf` files. All applets can be tailored to your specific needs.

They, however, do not assume theming by default, **as such, you need to make
your own Rofi theme**. Some example themes are provided in the `example`
directory.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

There are two ways of

### Prerequisites

#### Nix/NixOS + Home Manager (With Flakes)

To install and use these applets with Nix you will need:

* Nix installed on your system.
* A Home Manager ready configuration built **with flakes**.

#### Without Nix

Without Nix, installing these applets require their individual dependencies. For
every packages you will need at least:

* Rofi 1.7.5+
* Bash 5.2.21+

Dependencies for every applet

* Bluetooth applet:
  * Bluez with access to `bluetoothctl` command
  * GNU Grep
* Favorites applet:
  * All the applications you wish to run with `rofi-favorites` should be in your
  `PATH`
* MPD applet:
  * An MPD server up and running to use
  * MPC to control MPD in command line
  * Dunst for the `dunstify` command to send notifications
* Network-Manager applet:
  * This applet is external to this repository, if you wish to install it, you
  can find instructions [here][rofi-network-manager].
* Power-Profiles applet:
  * Power Profiles Daemon, with access to the `powerprofilesctl` command.
* Quicklinks applet:
  * XDG Utils, with access to the `xdg-open` command.

### Installation

#### Nix/NixOS + Home Manager (With Flakes)

We assume you have a fair bit of knowledge on how flakes with nix works.

1. Add this repository to your flake inputs:
```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";

    home-manager = {
      url = "github:nix-community/home-manager/master";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };

    rofi-applets = {
      url = "gitlab:Zhaith-Izaliel/rofi-applets";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs" # Optional
    };
  };
}
```
2. Add the packages overlay to your overlays in your outputs:
```nix
nixpkgs.overlays = [ inputs.rofi-applets.overlays.default ];
```

3. Add the modules to your Home Manager modules list:

```nix
inputs.home-manager.lib.homeManagerConfiguration {
  modules = [
    inputs.rofi-applets.homeManagerModules.${name} # Where name is the name of the applet module you wish to add
    # Alternatively you can import the `default` module which contains every applets
    inputs.rofi-applets.homeManagerModules.default
  ];
}
```
4. Every module provided by the flake are under `programs.rofi.applets.<name>`.
   You can start configuring from there!

##### Building applets with Rofi for X11, not Wayland

By default, the applets are built with the `rofi-wayland` package available in
Nixpkgs. However, it is possible to build with them `rofi` directly, if you
don't need to support Wayland.

To do so, override the packages definition:
```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:

{
  programs.rofi.applets.favorites.package = pkgs.rofi-favorites.override { useWayland = false; };
}
```
Replace `rofi-favorites` and `favorites` by the applet you want to override. You
can also override this package definition in `home.packages` and
`environment.systemPackages` in the same way.

#### Without Nix

1. Install the applets dependencies with your package manager.

2. Copy the applet you wish to install to `/usr/local/bin` and make it
   executable:
```bash
cp <applet-name>/<applet-name>.sh /usr/local/bin/<name>
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/<name>
```
3. Every applet configuration files are put into:
   `$HOME/.config/rofi/<name>.conf` and their theme are in
   `$HOME/.config/rofi/<name>.rasi`. For example `rofi-favorites` configuration
   file and theme are in `$HOME/.config/rofi/rofi-favorites.conf` and
   `$HOME/.config/rofi/rofi-bluetooth.rasi` respectively.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Each applet has its own documentation located in their corresponding directory.
You can find usage information in there!

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Fix Rofi MPD putting notifications in history
- [ ] Create our own Network-Manager applet following the same pattern of
configuration and theming options.

See the [open issues](https://gitlab.com/Zhaith-Izaliel/rofi-applets/-/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
